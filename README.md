# CBTCset
CBTCset is a dataset for misbehavior detection in Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) networks. It addresses the gap represented by the absence of public reference datasets
to detect attacks in CBTC networks. CBTCset can facilitate comparable evaluation of misbehavior detection techniques besides reproducibility and validation of results.


A scientific publication is [available](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301328) for CBTCset. If you find it useful in your research work, please consider citing as follows:
